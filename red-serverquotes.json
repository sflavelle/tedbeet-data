So she told me I had to be careful in the lighthouse, because if I went down the wrong hole, it deleted the save. So for the longest time, I thought the lighthouse would trap me and I would never be able to finish the game. I didn\u2019t go in there for ages until I realized I had to to finish the game.

You all played a bunch of games all the time during the day - including a game where you all looked for dildos on the ship. The room I rented had an extra charge if you masturbated, and they knew if you masturbated through a cord attached to your bed that measured vibrations. I was really upset by this because it measured even small vibrations as masturbation. A little sign in the lobby read ''MASTURBATIONS: 1.'' So I broke the cord and told the manager that I found it that way. One day, when you were all looking for dildos, Phil called and said that where I was parked on the ship was only noon to 4PM, so he said he could move it for me. And Phil had a spare key for some reason. I started running through LA to get to the cruise because I was worried you would all break into my room and find a dildo and make fun of me. I started telling Phil over the phone that renting the room was a really bad idea, in spite of the very cheap price I paid for it. What a weird dream."

As a kid, the music and atmosphere were unsettling. My sister was playing it and she was running out of batteries, and she saved in the lighthouse, and the GameBoy ran out of batteries during saving and corrupted the save. So she told me I had to be careful in the lighthouse, because if I went down the wrong hole, it deleted the save. So for the longest time, I thought the lighthouse would trap me and I would never be able to finish the game. I didn’t go in there for ages until I realized I had to to Tobi the game. Later on, in Leaf Green, I finally realized that if you turn the power off while saving, it corrupts your game."
